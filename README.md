Problem Definition:
“Siya naa piyasa” is an agriculture shop which is located in Gampaha district. They work closely with
farmers to enhance their incomes and develop the industry. They provide support and expert advice on the
use of agricultural equipment, selection of fertilizer and seeds and better farm management practices.
Customers are able to purchase agriculture equipment, fertilizer and seeds from this shop under their
guidance. Currently they do not have a web based purchase system for their marketing purpose. As we
were noted, we got to know about some key points of issues of their selling system without a web based
purchase system.
 If a customer needs to purchase an item under the guidance, he/she has to go to the shop.
Customers are not able to get to know about their products without going there and they do not
have a way to submit suggestions and feedbacks about their service.
 Customers of “Siya naa piyasa” do not have an online purchase system.
 The service of “Siya naa piyasa” is only known by people who are in the particular area. They do
not have a proper way to advertise themselves among the customers.
Solution:
As we discussed about the problems of the client, we thought to give them a solution by developing a web
based purchase system which includes these features and functionalities.
 A web page for the client.
(All the information about the client, their products and their service will be included in order to
advertising purposes.)
 A road map to find the shop for customers.
 Online purchase system
(Customers will be able to order the items as they want without going. But They will have to go
there to pay and get the items.)
 Online help function for customers.
(Customers will be able to ask questions through the website and they will be able to get answers
for their problems. This function will be a significant fact to the client to build a good image
among the customers.)
 A function which customers can give feed backs about the service of the client.
